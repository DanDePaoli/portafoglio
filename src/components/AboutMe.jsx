<p>Iâ€™m a passionate engineer and devout lifelong learner. I believe in challenge as the path to personal growth and business as a platform for change. After a successful 8 year stint working in marketing for tech startups I transitioned to software engineering. I deeply enjoy the analytical and creative challenge of building clean, scalable systems. Right now I work mostly with Javascript (Node, React, etc) and Python.</p>
